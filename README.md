# Cistercian Numerals

Cistercian Numerals is a small web app I developed after learning about the [titular numeral system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cistercian_numerals) developed by the Cistercian monks in the early 13th century.

## Understanding the System

The Cistercian numberals allow for one 'glyph' (or 'cipher') to represent any integer between 1 and 9999. Digits are composed together to create a single glyph. The orientation of a digit determines its place value (units, tens, hundreds, or thousands).
